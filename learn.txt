JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

for html element :- document.getElementId()

for testing purpose using :- document.write()
The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:


for output on console using :- console.log()
For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.

for window alert using :- window.alert()
 to display the data , we can use alert box
